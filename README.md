# GAB-sentiment-analysis
As part of my dissertation im attempting to conduct an analysis of posts from GAB surrounding certain dates. 
Here is the dataset https://files.pushshift.io/gab/
Here is the documentation provided for the API https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aN7DZxluW4Ty884AwnNB-Nzk0FHOsqK4DIEo8hG4e4I/edit
Ive had some success using the URI search but cant seem to convert the fies into a usable CSV or to get the python snippet working. When i try to run it in jupyter it throws an error at sys.exit(r.content)
